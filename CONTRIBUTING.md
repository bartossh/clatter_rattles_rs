# Contributing

- Contributors are welcome. Suggestions and ideas are welcome too.
- For now, this project is more about fun and learning how to build libs in the Rust language than real usage, but do not assume that it is empty work.
- I will maintain the project in small steps as needed. So, do not expect too many features, if any. I will see.
